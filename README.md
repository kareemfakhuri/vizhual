## Inspiration
The elusive nature of high-frequency trading piqued our interest. We wanted to take a deeper dive into the various features of the data that arises from generated datasets. While the test data contains limited information, we believe there are many fascinating ways in which we can illustrate and animate it.

## What it does
Vizhualize processes exchange-flows in a unique way that allows it to illustrate data that would otherwise seem nuancedâ€”at a nanosecond level. That is not all, we also make sure that the financial crowd understands the importance of having a secure password.

## How we built it
We developed the visualizer with real-time data in mind. The backend is fully equipped to receive, process, and index exchange notifications in real time. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had a difficult time choosing the frontend charting framework. We wanted high flexibility and great aesthetics at the cost of time.

Preparing the backend and frontend for real-time analytics was equally as hard as we had to create an artificial stream of messages using the test data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
While it took us all night, we were able to address our challenges without any major sacrifices. Okay, maybe a few; we couldn't add a dropdown containing the list of all traded symbols within the period.
